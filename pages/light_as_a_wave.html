<p>You will remember that electric charges are producing electric fields everywhere in space, and these electric fields are what cause the electric force of repulsion and attraction between charges. We also saw that if the electric field (E) is changing (for example, if an electron is moving in a current), it creates a magnetic field B.</p>

<h2>The Electromagnetic Wave</h2>

<p>As you might have guessed already, this back and forth—E creates a back-and forth B which then creates E— which... can go on indefinitely in the form of a traveling wave as shown below. A changing E field induces a changing B field. This back and forth is a wave, known as light!</p>

<p>Electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light with the usual relation of wavelength and frequency:</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;c = \lambda f&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>where c stands for the speed of light.</p>

<h2>Amplitude, Power and Intensity</h2>

<p>Just like any other wave, the electromagnetic wave has, in addition to a wavelength and frequency, an amplitude (A). The bigger the amplitude, the more energy and momentum it carries.</p>

<p>Instead of talking about the amplitude, we often talk about the intensity of a wave I. This is the average energy transferred over a certain area. This is averaged over one cycle of oscillation. The intensity can be written as the power (energy per time) divided by the area</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt; I = \frac {\rm{Power}}{\rm{Area}} &lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>if you double the amplitude of a wave, the amount of energy per second per unit of area will quadruple.</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt; Intensity \propto \rm{Amplitude}^2&lt;/lrn-math&gt; </p>

<p>The unit of intensity is Watts per meter squared &lt;lrn-math&gt;W/m^2&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>
