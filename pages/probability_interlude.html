<p>To understand how photons behave, we need to take a pause and talk about probability.</p>

<p>Imagine the following situation: You are blindfolded and throwing darts at a dartboard as shown in the image below. You roughly know where the dartboard is and most of your shots are near the center. After a 100 shots, you get this pattern (see fig):</p>

<h2>Defining Probability</h2>

<p>Because 45 out of 100 throws ended up in region A, we could say that the chance of hitting region A is 45%. In general we can say that the probability of hitting region A is just the number of hits in A divided by the total.</p>

<p><lrn-math>\P<em>A = \frac{N</em>A}{N_{tot}}</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>This probability is more and more accurate as the total number of throws gets really large. Similarly, we can define the probability of throwing in region B and C (<lrn-math>\P<em>B</lrn-math>\ and <lrn-math>\P</em>C</lrn-math>\) by counting the number of throws in region B or C (<lrn-math>\N<em>B</lrn-math>\ or <lrn-math>\N</em>C</lrn-math>\) and dividing it by the total number of throws (<lrn-math>\N_{TOT}</lrn-math>\). The bigger the total number of throws, the more accurate the probability becomes.</p>

<h2>The Word OR</h2>

<p>Let's say you want to know the probability that the dart was in region A <strong>OR</strong> region B. What do you do?</p>

<p>Since it does not matter which one, you just count all throws that landed in A or B.</p>

<p><lrn-math>\P<em>{A\; or \; B} = \frac{N</em>A + N<em>B}{N</em>{tot}} = P<em>A+P</em>B</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>So, the probability of hitting A or B is the sum of the probability of hitting A and probability of hitting B. So in our example this would be 35% + 45% = 80%.</p>

<p>Note that the chance of hitting anything at all (A OR B OR C) should be 1 or 100%.</p>

<p><lrn-math>\P<em>A+P</em>B+P_C =1</lrn-math>\</p>

<blockquote><p>As we will see, quantum mechanics is special when it comes to adding probability because of interference which happens.</p><p>Note: A probability must be a pure number (no units) between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain). Often the number is represented as a percentage or as a fraction. For example a probability of p = 0.25 can be represented as 25% ,25/100 or as 1/4. One chance out of 4 is a probability p=0.25.</p></blockquote>
