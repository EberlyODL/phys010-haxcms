<p>We distinguish four different states of matter and the distinction is all about how the atoms are bound, or linked together between atoms. Matters around you take many different forms depending on how atoms are combined. Which form of matter you will have under which conditions ultimately depends on the electrical potential energy (chemical bonds between atoms) and the kinetic energy of the atoms.</p>

<p>The four states are</p>

<ol><li><strong>Solid</strong>: Atoms stuck in place.</li><li><strong>Liquid</strong>: Atoms still linked to each other weakly but allowed to move and slip around each other.</li><li><strong>Gas</strong>: Atoms are completely free to move around.</li><li><strong>Plasma</strong>: Some electrons are freed from the atoms to move independently.</li></ol>

<p>The study of these various states of matter, most particularly the first one, the solid state, is the biggest area of research in physics. Because all the atoms are bound to each other in a rigid system, there exists a long-range order that can lead to some extremely interesting phenomena like superconductivity. We will discuss some of these phenomena later on but this is a vast field of research and we will only scratch the surface.</p>

<p>We can form atomic bonds between atoms to form a solid. There are two basic types of solids, <em>crystal</em> (like metals and salts) which have an orderly pattern, and <em>amorphous</em> solids (like plastic and glass) which have no such patterns.</p>

<p>In a solid, the atoms or molecules do not move very much but they can still vibrate and rotate. <strong>If the atoms can move and slip past each other we then have a liquid</strong>. In a liquid, the atoms are still close to one another but they can move. They share atomic bonds with their neighbors but there is no long-range structure or order. Finally, if the atoms and molecules are not bound (chemically/electrically) at all and just move freely, we have a gas. The atoms/molecules just fly around and once in a while bounce into each other.  </p>

<p>The final state of matter is the plasma. This is like a gas but where the atoms/molecules have been ionized and we have free electrons moving around unattached. The sun is not a big ball of gas. It is a big plasma ball. The atmosphere is not all gases, in the upper reaches, it is a plasma. Finally, in your plasma TV, well, you have a plasma. So this state of matter while less known is nevertheless pretty important!</p>
