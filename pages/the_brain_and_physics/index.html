<h3>The Brain</h3>

<p>Some people believe that intellectual ability is purely genetic or fixed.</p>

<p>This is a myth. Research now shows that your brain is like a muscle; the more you apply it and struggle, the more it grows. People who learn to recognize this fact about their own brain develop a ‘growth mindset’ and are able to persevere and achieve more.</p>

<p>There is only one way to learn physics (or anything else), it is by doing it, again and again. The assignments are the most important part of this class.</p>

<h3>Physics</h3>

<p>Physics is the science that tries to understand how the natural world works. We are particularly interested in the study of energy and matter. People are often scared about physics because of the math and all the formulas. Well be assured</p>

<p>Physics is not about memorizing formulas<br/> (though we will memorize a few)<br/> Physics is not about “plug-and-chug”</p>

<p>Physics is about changing how you think about the world around you.</p>

<p>This course is about reasoning about physics - what are the big ideas (there is only a few), where we see them at work, and how they affect our world!</p>
