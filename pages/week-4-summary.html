<p>This week was a short week about a complicated concept. </p>

<ul><li><p>Waves can cancel and reinforce. (This is called interference.)</p></li><li><p>When two waves with different shapes meet, you can just add the shapes directly on top of each other to figure out the combined pattern.</p></li><li><p>You should be able to recognize the interference pattern of a double slit and explain the physics behind those images.</p></li><li><p>Waves can be found in sound, light, and on a string</p></li><li><p>Standing waves happen when they bounce back and forth within a tube (or on a string) - this is how musical instruments work. You should be able to identify the harmonic number of a standing wave. </p></li></ul>
