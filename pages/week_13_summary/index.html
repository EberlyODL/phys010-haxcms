<p>Summary:</p>

<ul><li>The nuclear force is short range and affect protons and neutrons equally. It is stronger than the electric force and it overcomes the repulsion between protons.</li><li>Each nuclei has some average binding energy. Some nuclei are more stable than others. Iron-56 is the most stable atom in the world. Helium is particularly stable.</li><li>There are three types of radiation. Alpha which is just helium; Beta, which is just an electron; and Gamma, which is a photon.</li><li>Alpha particles are emitted when a nucleus above iron spontaneously decays. Polonium is a good example.</li><li>Gamma particles are emitted by atoms in excited states. The energy levels inside the nucleus are quantized just like the energy levels of the electrons are quantized.</li><li>Half-life is the time it takes for half of the current number of radioactive material to decay.</li><li>Nuclear reactors currently work on the U-235 cycle. You should be able to describe this cycle (each step).</li><li>What is one of the radioactive wastes in nuclear reactors?</li><li>A chain reaction is a reaction that keeps increasing and can get out of control.</li><li>We use cadmium bars to control the chain reaction in nuclear reactors because they absorb neutrons.</li></ul>
