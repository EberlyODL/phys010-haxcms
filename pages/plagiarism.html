<p>I would like to emphasize one part of the academic integrity principle of Penn State about plagiarism. </p>

<p><img src="assets/cutpaste.png" width="229" height="183" alt="no cut and paste"></p>

<p>Of course all the academic integrity principles are important (like cheating) but plagiarism is the most misunderstood. Students may plagiarize without even being aware of it and this is still a violation of academic principles.</p>

<h3>Examples of Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Lets first start with some example of plagiarism</p>

<ol><li>Submit a paper for grading that you did not write yourself</li><li>Copy answers or text from a colleague and submit is as your own</li><li>Quote or paraphrase from another paper without giving credit to the author</li><li>Cite data without giving credit to the original source</li><li>Propose someone else’s idea as if it were yours</li><li>Fabricate or use incorrect references</li><li>Submit another’s presentation, program or spreadsheet with only small changes</li></ol>

<p>These are pretty clear cut violations of Penn State academic principles. What about the following case?</p>

<h3>Carelessness Case Study</h3>

<p><strong>How to avoid this.</strong> Be careful with how you take notes - avoid typing while reading. The best way to know you are writing with your own words is to close your source (book, browser, etc) while writing the notes. </p>

<h3>Consequences of Plagiarism</h3>

<p>In the real world, you can get sued, lose your job or lose your reputation. You can find on this Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_plagiarism_incidents">page</a> many famous examples of plagiarism with very often dire consequences for the person who did it.</p>

<p>For students at Penn State, <strong>plagiarism will</strong> result sanctions. For more on academic integrity see http://science.psu.edu/current-students/Integrity/Policy.html </p>

<ul><li>Wikipedia is the main source of plagiarism (and the easiest to spot). Here is a <strong>very good</strong> video from the PSU library: <a href="https://libraries.psu.edu/how-use-wikipedia-tutorial">How to use Wikipedia</a>.</li></ul>
