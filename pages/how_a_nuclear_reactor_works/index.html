<h2>Controlling the Chain Reaction</h2>

<p>We control the chain reaction by inserting a bar of cadmium, which absorbs the neutrons (see Fig. "Cadmium Bars") - thus slowing down or speeding up the chain reaction in a controlled way. These are known as the "control rods".</p>

<h2>Nuclear Waste</h2>

<p>If  the only nuclear waste was U-235, nuclear waste would be small, but, of course, that is not the only thing around. The fuel bar contains mostly U-238 which can also absorb neutrons. When it does, it becomes Plutonium-239 (see Fig. "P-239 Radioactive Waste"). </p>

<p>PU-239 can also be used in the nuclear reactor, but mostly it's a dangerous waste because it emits alpha particles, and we are just stuck with it. The half-life for Plutonium is</p>

<p><lrn-math>\t_{\frac12}</lrn-math>\ = 24,000 years</p>

<p>This is a horrible number. If it was 30 years half-life, than after 1000 years, all the radiation in the nuclear waste facilities would be gone. But with such a long half-life (24,000 years), plutonium waste is going to remain with us for a really long time.</p>
