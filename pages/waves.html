<p>We are nearing the end of the basic building blocks of nature! Only two more blocks to go, <strong>waves</strong> and then the <strong>space-time continuum</strong>. Let's remember what we have seen up to now. The world is made of atoms which are themselves made of electrons and a nucleus which is made of protons and neutrons. These particles have energy which can take many forms. Energy is the ability to do work.</p>

<p>So where do waves fit in this picture?</p>

<ul><li>M: There are many different type of waves: sound, waves in water, pulse on a string, light, and many more.</li><li>S It is hard to see what those things have in common.</li><li>M: Well that's what we do in physics—find out what is common to all things!</li><li>M: The basic definition of a wave is “It is a disturbance from equilibrium that propagates with time from one region of space to another."</li><li><p>M: In the slow motion movie below we see water which is made of a very large number of atoms. When a droplet falls on the surface it creates a disturbance which propagates away from where the droplet fell. That is the wave. If you have a single droplet falling, we get a single non-repeating disturbance. We call that a pulse. If your faucet was leaking a droplet every second, we would get a periodic repeating wave in the water.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="215" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CJ-AX1G0SmY" width="320">\ </iframe></p></li></ul>

<h2>Oscillations vs Waves</h2>

<ul><li>Oscillations: Something that oscillates back and forth <ul><li>Described by a period (T), a frequency (f) and an amplitude (A).</li></ul></li><li>Wave: A type of oscillation (disturbance) that travels in space. <ul><li>Described by a period (T), a frequency (f) and an amplitude (A) like an oscillation</li><li>But also has a wavelength <lrn-math>\\lambda</lrn-math>\ which is the distance between wave crests.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>A wave varies in space with wavelength <lrn-math>\\lambda</lrn-math>\. A plot of a wave variation in space looks like</p>

<p><img src="assets/wavegraph.jpg" width="641" height="281" alt="Graph of wave. Vertical axis is height (y) from -5 m to 5m. Horizontal axis is distance x  from x =0 to x=8 m. The wave oscillate back and forth along the x direction. "></p>

<p>The wavelength is the distance between peaks. <strong>Note that position, x, not the time, is on the horizontal axis.</strong> This is important not to confuse this figure ("Graphical Representation of Wave") with the oscillation graph ("Graph of an Oscillatory Motion").</p>
