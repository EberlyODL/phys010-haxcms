<p>We saw that photons are described by a wave whose amplitude is the electric field, and it varies in space and in time <lrn-math>\E(x,t)</lrn-math>\. The square of the amplitude of the oscillating E-field is proportional to the intensity, but, more importantly, the intensity gives you the <strong>probability</strong> function of where you are likely (or not likely) to find the photon.</p>

<p>The same story repeats itself for the electron, or any other particles for that matter. In this case, the amplitude of the wave is called <lrn-math>\\psi(x)</lrn-math>\. We then have the probability of finding an electron in a given region of space <lrn-math>\\delta x</lrn-math>\ is</p>

<p><lrn-math>\\rm{Prob}(\rm{in}\;\delta x\; \rm{at}\; x) \propto \psi(x)^2</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>The subject of quantum mechanics is partly about finding the wavefunction <lrn-math>\\psi(x)</lrn-math>\ for a given system. Once we know the wavefunction, we can tell the probability of finding the particle here or there. This is not as hard as it sounds, since <lrn-math>\\psi(x)</lrn-math>\ is a wave like any other wave. In particular, it can have standing wave patterns, which we have seen before.</p>

<h2>An Electron in a Box</h2>

<p>Imagine that one single electron is stuck in a box. Inside the box, there is no electric field and no electric potential energy, but on the edge of the box there is a strong force that blocks the electron's way, just like a wall. We can represent this with a potential energy graph like Fig. "Electron Box".</p>

<p><img src="assets/waves_in_box_0.jpg" width="336" height="309" alt=""></p>

<p>Since the edge of the box is a wall, the electron cannot be found there. Since the amplitude of the wave is the probability of finding the electron, we must have that the wave is zero on the wall. The wave is "pinned" just like a string can be attached at both ends. Just like the guitar string, only a special set of waves (or notes) is allowed as depicted. So using the de Broglie relationship and the allowed quantized wavelength standing waves, we find that the momentum of the electrons must be quantized.</p>

<p><lrn-math>\\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n} = \frac{h}{p}</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>where L is the size of the box and n is an integer (1,2,3...). We conclude that the momentum of an electron inside of a box is a multiple integer of a basic unit, let's call this basic unit <lrn-math>\p_1</lrn-math>\.</p>

<p><lrn-math>\p = n p_1</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>Similarly, the only energy the electron has inside the box is kinetic energy <lrn-math>\K=\frac12 mv^2 = \frac{p^2}{2m}</lrn-math>\ where I wrote the formula in terms of momentum. So the allowed energy of the electron goes like momentum squared.</p>

<p><lrn-math>\E<em>n = n^2 E</em>1</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>In this equation <lrn-math>\E_1</lrn-math>\ is a basic quantum of energy which depends on the size of the box, the mass of the particle, etc. The details we will not get into now. </p>

<p>Let me summarize this again, since this is important:
<strong>By imposing a rule that the wave of the electron vanishes at some places (ie. it can't go outside the walls), we get standing wave patterns with different harmonic wavelengths. This implies that the momentum and energy of the electron are quantized. That means that not all values of E and p are possible. Only special values that are integer multiples (or integer squared) of a basic unit.</strong></p>

<p>S: Pause.. what exactly does quantized mean again?
M: Great time to remind everyone - quantized means that only specific values (of energy or momentum, or wave pattern) are allowed, usually this shows up by an integer in the equation ("n") - that can only be 1,2,3... and never 0.4, 1.5, etc. Like standing waves
S: right. standing waves were quantized too, because of the "n", and electrons behave like waves with fixed ends, so.. I see.</p>

<p>Note that n=0 is NOT possible, since the electron would have zero energy and we know that it must at least have its rest mass energy. So the lowest energy an electron can have is <lrn-math>\E_1</lrn-math>\ for n=1, the first harmonic. Fig. "Energy in Box" shows the first four levels of energy for an electron in a box.</p>

<h2>Finding the Electron in the Box</h2>

<p>The different wavefunctions of the electrons contain a lot of information. By taking the square of the wave, i.e. by squaring the amplitude at each point, we get information as to where the electron will most probably be found or not.</p>

<p>Each standing wave has nodes where the amplitude is always zero. At those points, the electron will never be found. For example, an electron in the third state <lrn-math>\E<em>3</lrn-math>\ will never be in the walls but also at two spots in the middle (see Fig. "The First 3 States"). Can you make similar arguments for where electrons are not allowed at <lrn-math>\E</em>1</lrn-math>\ and <lrn-math>\E_2</lrn-math>\?</p>
