<p>Up to now, we have looked at spontaneous radioactive decay that leads to either alpha radiation or gamma radiation. Nuclear fission, on the other hand, is about externally triggering the breakup of a nucleus.</p>

<p>The basic idea of fission is to hit a nucleus with a high-energy neutron that will split the atom and eject alpha particles and more neutrons. Large amounts of energy can be released in this process. The source of that energy ultimately stems from the nuclear potential energy but we usually just say mass energy. In fission, the atom you start with weighs more than the sum of the broken pieces (the extra mass energy is turned into kinetic energy of the broken pieces). This is a large source of energy that we can and do tap in nuclear reactors.</p>

<h2>Fuel for Fission reactions</h2>

<p>There are three main fuels that we can easily do fission with in nature.</p>

<ul><li><strong>U-235:</strong> This is a radioactive isotope of Uranium. It occurs naturally in nature. You could find it in your backyard . . .</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>U-233:</strong> This is another radioactive isotope of Uranium. It does not exist in nature but it can be created by bombarding Thorium-232 with neutrons.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Plutonium-239</strong>: It does not exist in nature but it can be created by bombarding Uranium-238 (which is available in nature in large quantities) with neutrons. </li></ul>

<h2>Uranium Cycle</h2>

<p>The current system used for nuclear fission in nuclear reactors relies on U-235 and it is called the Uranium Cycle. Here are the basics:</p>

<p>We first mine for Uranium-238, which can be found in pretty large quantities (40 x more uranium on Earth than silver). It is almost stable: t½ is about 4.468 billions years old.</p>

<p>A typical sample of U-238 will contain 0.7% of U-235 with a half-life t½ of about 703,800,000 years. In order to effectively do fission we need more U-235 than that and so we have a procedure called "Uranium enrichment" in which we increase the % of U-235 in the U-238 sample - concentrating it. We then create a rod with this enriched uranium and we send high-speed neutrons toward it.</p>

<p>When U-235 absorbs a neutron, it becomes U-236 which is really unstable- this causes the whole atom to break apart into Krypton and Barium (see <a href="http://www.webelements.com/" target="_blank">\table of element</a>\ for Kr and Ba); see Fig. "Uranium Cycle". </p>

<p>When U-236 breaks it also releases three neutrons (these neutrons can be used to further the fission). All the particles in the end process have a lot of kinetic energy. This leads to thermal energy and the thermal energy from the nuclear reaction can be used to work a steam engine and create electricity!</p>
