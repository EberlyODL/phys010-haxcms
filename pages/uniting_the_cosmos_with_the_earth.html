<p>You may have heard the story of Newton and the apple. This popular story is that Newton got knocked on the head by an apple and then suddenly realized the Universal law of gravity.</p>

<p>Like most popular stories, it is probably not true but it contains an element of truth. What probably happened is that Newton, after seeing apples falling, realized that if the tree was higher, the force of gravity would keep acting on the apples. He then asked the question:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>What if the tree was as high as the moon? Wouldn't gravity still work?</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The really big insight of Newton is not "just" that he discovered the law of gravity. The big insight is that he realized that the law is universal. It applies on the Earth and it applies in the cosmos, and it is the same force everywhere. It turns out that electromagnetism is also a long-range force but because large objects tend to be neutral, the force of electricity does not have as much of an impact in the cosmos. In any case, Newton did not even know about electricity back in those days.</p>

<p>Since the force of gravity is always attractive, it wins on large distances and it becomes the most important force driving structure formation such as stars, planets and galaxies in our Universe. </p>

<blockquote><p>For comparison, the two nuclear forces are short range and only apply on small length scales such as the nucleus.</p></blockquote>

<p>So in 1687, in his famous work "Principia Mathematica", Newton proposed the <em>Universal</em> law of Gravitation with emphasis on the universal part of it. The law states that any two objects with mass <lrn-math>\m<em>1</lrn-math>\ and <lrn-math>\m</em>2</lrn-math>\ attract each other with a force proportional to both masses and inversely proportional the distance between the objects squared, see Fig. "Law of Gravity".</p>

<p>The constant G is know as the Newton's gravitational constant. It is equal to <lrn-math>\G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}\; N\;m^2/kg^2</lrn-math>\</p>

<ul><li>S: This force is between any two objects right?</li><li>M: Yes.</li><li>S: So there is a force of gravity between the table and me?</li><li>M: Yes, but it is really small. Gravity is really the weakest of all forces and the only reason you feel it so much is because it acts universally, it is always attractive and there are some big massive objects like the Earth out there.</li></ul>

<h2>Optional:</h2>

<p>The Universal law of Gravity does reduce to the simpler relationship we saw earlier <lrn-math>\F=mg</lrn-math>\. You just take the more general law <lrn-math>\F = G m<em>1m</em>2/r^2</lrn-math>\ and you replace the radius with the radius of the Earth and the mass of the second object with the mass of the Earth and you get</p>

<p><lrn-math>\F = m_1 g</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>where the little g factor is equal to <lrn-math>\G m<em>{earth}/r</em>{earth}^2 = 9.8\; m/s^2</lrn-math>\</p>
