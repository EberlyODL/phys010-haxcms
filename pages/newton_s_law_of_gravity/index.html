<p>Newton was the first to correctly describe the force of gravity that Galileo was studying. He found that near the surface of the Earth the force of gravity is indeed just proportional to the mass of the object</p>

<p><lrn-math>\ F_g = m g</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>where the constant <lrn-math>\g = 9.8\; m/s^2</lrn-math>\ is known as the gravitational acceleration (technically this value of <lrn-math>\g</lrn-math>\ only works on the surface of the earth). <lrn-math>\F_g</lrn-math>\ is the force of gravity or the <strong>weight</strong> of an object and it should not be confused with mass! I remind you that the SI unit of Force is called the Newton. </p>

<ul><li>Weight is measured in pounds (lbs) or Newton (N). These are both units of force.</li><li>Mass is measured in kilogram.</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>If you take your <strong>mass in kilogram</strong> and you multiply by <lrn-math>\9.8 \;m/s^2</lrn-math>\, you will get <strong>your weight in Newtons</strong>. You can then convert Newtons to pounds if you want. 1 lbs is approximately 4.4 Newtons.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Why does it take the same time for the hammer and the feather to fall?</h2>

<p>The force of gravity does depend on the mass and it is bigger on the hammer than on the feather. How is it that the time to fall is the same for both??</p>

<p>The fact that free fall <strong>time</strong> does <strong>not</strong> depend on the mass has to do with one crucial aspect that makes gravity special compared to the other forces.</p>

<p>The analog of electric charge for gravity is the mass but mass is also related to inertia. The more mass you have the harder it is to move. The more mass you have the harder it is to change your momentum.</p>

<p>So the force of gravity is stronger on the hammer and thus the change in momentum of the hammer is going to be bigger. But the momentum is <em>also</em> proportional to the mass <lrn-math>\p=mv</lrn-math>\. So the fact that the momentum is bigger does not result in a bigger speed. You need more force to get the hammer moving than you need for the feather. The two effects (bigger force of gravity, bigger inertia of hammer) cancel exactly and the hammer arrives at the same time as the feather!</p>

<p>If you like equations,...</p>

<p>You remember that force is just change of momentum</p>

<p><lrn-math>\ F \Delta t = \Delta p = m \Delta v</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>The case of gravity is special because the force depends on the mass <lrn-math>\(F = mg)</lrn-math>\ so you can cancel it on both sides! You get</p>

<p><lrn-math>\ mg \Delta t = m \Delta v </lrn-math>\ 
<lrn-math>\ g \Delta t = \Delta v </lrn-math>\</p>

<p>The conclusion is that the time it takes to fall only depends on the velocity (and the constant g). The only thing that matters is whether the hammer and the feather are <em>thrown</em> downward or simply dropped. The mass of the object is irrelevant for the time it takes to free fall!</p>
