<h2>The discovery of the Higgs particle.</h2>

<p>As you probably have heard, the LHC was turned on a few years ago (and despite concerns, the world did not end), producing invaluable data for quite a while now, and the Higgs boson was discovered as expected! (maybe unexpected ones are to come?).</p>

<p>I recommend this short video by Brian Greene on the Higgs field and the Higgs particle.</p>

<p>Maybe the collider will detect new physics. One always has to be careful in science and discoveries take a while. </p>

<h2>Newsflash: Hints of new physics</h2>

<p>The key word is hints!</p>

<p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/physicists-excited-by-latest-lhc-anomaly-1.21865&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hint of new particles?&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>I choose this article because the media often jumps quickly on &quot;hints&quot; of new physics. Way too quickly in my opinion. Almost always, these hints turn out to be nothing. I am betting this particular discrepancy is probably just a fluke and I will wait until more data is collected and analyzed before getting excited.</p>

<h2>Extra resources:</h2>

<p>Before they turned the LHC on in 2008, some were concerned about it destroying the world. This produced &lt;a href=&quot;http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/&quot;&gt;memes &lt;/a&gt; in the science community, but was indeed a big deal. If you are interested here&#39;s a link to read: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/will-the-lhc-destroy-the-earth-2015-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Will the LHC destroy the earth? &lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully, the scientists were right. </p>
