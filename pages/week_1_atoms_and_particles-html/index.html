<h2>Welcome to Phys 010: Physics Behind the Headlines!</h2>

<p>In the weekly lessons, you will often see many discussions between Sophie and Marie. Sophie is a virtual student at Penn State and just like you she is super interested in learning physics and she is full of questions. Marie is a successful (but still virtual :) graduate student in physics who will try to answer all of Sophie's questions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sophie: Hi there everybody! As this class is online you cannot ask questions in the lecture. But I am a virtual person...</li>



  <li>Marie: Just like me.</li>



  <li>S: So I can interrupt and ask questions.</li>



  <li>M: actually I have a question.</li>



  <li>S: But wait, you are the know-it all instructor! I am the one who ask the questions.</li>



  <li>M: Normally yes, but let me start with the first question.</li>



  <li>S: I have feeling I will not know the answer.</li>



  <li>M: So you said we are virtual people. That must mean we exist as bytes of 0 and 1 on a computer.</li>



  <li>S: I am already lost...</li>



  <li>M: Here is my question, could we have a soul or are we just machines?</li>



  <li>S: ...I thought this was a class about science not a philosophy class about souls.</li>



  <li>M: Yeah I know.... but just wondering...</li>
