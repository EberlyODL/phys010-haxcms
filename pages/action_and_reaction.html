<h2>Newton&#39;s Third Law</h2>

<p>This is often the most mysterious of the three but you already have seen it in this class! Fundamentally, this law is the same as the statement that momentum is conserved but here is how it is usually phrased.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>If the Earth attracts you gravitationally with some force, this law says that you attract the Earth with the <strong>same exact equal force</strong> (but opposite direction). This is weird since the Earth does not appear to be falling (while you do) but remember that same force does not mean same speed!</p>

<p>This law is just the statement that if the Earth via gravity makes you move faster and change your momentum. Your loss (or gain) of momentum must go somewhere. It goes to the Earth. So</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;\Delta p<em>{Earth} = - \Delta p</em>{me}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>If the change in momentum for both are the same (remember recoil!) and the interaction happens over the same time then the force must be the same ( &lt;lrn-math&gt; F\Delta t = \Delta p&lt;/lrn-math&gt;), except for the sign (+ or -), which is why we say the 2 forces are equal and opposite!</p>

<p>In general when 2 objects interact, the &lt;lrn-math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/lrn-math&gt; of one object must equal the negative &lt;lrn-math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/lrn-math&gt; of the other object, and the two feel equal and opposite forces.  </p>
