<p>Last week, we discussed how light can be thought to be made of particles with energy</p>

<p><lrn-math>\E = hf</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>where <em>h</em> is known as Planck's constant. The frequency <em>f</em> is the number of cycles per second that we would measure of a light wave. Note how strange this is.  A property of the wave, the frequency, determines the energy of the light particle...</p>

<p>Planck's constant is a small number equal to <lrn-math>\h = 6.63\times 10^{-34}\; J\; s</lrn-math>\. The units of <em>h</em> are Joules times second. The particles of light are called photons.</p>

<h2>The Photon</h2>

<p>The photon is a fundamental particle just like the electron. As far as we know it has no substructure (it is not made of anything else). It is a fundamental particle of nature and it has the following properties:</p>

<ol><li>It has a mass of 0; i.e., it is massless.</li><li>It has an electric charge of 0; i.e., it is (electrically) neutral.</li></ol>

<p>To answer the next questions you may want to review energy in special relativity (since the photon moves at the speed of light, relativity is necessary) and electricity.  </p>

<p>So light is made of particles called the photons. But as we have seen it is also an electromagnetic wave, which is a disturbance in the electromagnetic field. This was demonstrated in your first lab where you saw dark and bright fringes after light went through a double slit. These dark and bright fringes resulted from constructive and destructive interference which can only be explained using the principle of superposition that applies to waves! </p>

<p>So, how can we reconcile this dual nature of wave and particle?</p>
