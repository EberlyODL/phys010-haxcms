<p>Ok to summarize. </p>

<p>Light is a wave but we "detect" the wave as a collection of photons. A wave of frequency f is made of photons with energy <lrn-math>\E=hf</lrn-math>\. The amplitude of the wave gives the probability amplitude of finding a photon at point in space x. To get the probability (intensity) you square the probability amplitude. </p>

<blockquote><p>When multiple waves arrive on the same spot, the principle of superposition of wave says to add the amplitude of each wave first, and then square to get the probability. This may result in surprising cancellations and enhancements in the probability of finding photons at some locations versus others! </p></blockquote>

<p>This interference will occur <em>even when</em> we send a single photon thru the double slit. In some sense, the photon interferes with itself. </p>

<h2>Complementary</h2>

<p>This is already strange but now comes the really weird stuff. </p>

<p>Suppose we modify the double slit experiment so that we can tell which slit the photon went through. We can for example put a photon detector that clicks when a photon pass by but does not absorb it so that the photon can keep going. </p>

<p>If we do this experiment, what we find is that if we know that the photon went through slit 1 we see the probability amplitude is <lrn-math>\\phi<em>1</lrn-math>\ with no interference. If we detect that it went through slit 2, then we will see the <lrn-math>\\phi</em>2</lrn-math>\ pattern, again, with no interference!</p>

<p>There are two ways to describe this</p>

<ol><li><p>The two measurements are complementary. There is no physical way to detect which slit the photons went through and detect the interference pattern <strong>at the same time</strong>. </p></li><li><p>The act of measuring the photon changes the "state" of the system. Once we know that the photon went through slit 1, we know we should use <lrn-math>\\phi<em>1</lrn-math>\ to predict the probability on the screen. (not <lrn-math>\\phi</em>1+\phi_2</lrn-math>\). 
If we know that the photon went through slit 1, it will affect all further probabilities and it will destroy the interference pattern.</p></li></ol>

<p>In the modern way of doing quantum mechanics, we often talk about information. Extracting information (no matter how) will affect all future probabilities. In some ways, you can say the slogan</p>

<blockquote><p>Quantum mechanics is what happens when nobody is looking. If you look, then interference effect disappears!</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is a nice video summarizing some of these ideas. </p>
