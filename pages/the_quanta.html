<h2>Einstein's Explanation. </h2>

<p>In 1905, Einstein had a very productive year.  It is often referred to as the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus<em>Mirabilis</em>papers" target="_blank">\Annus Mirabilis</a>\. He was 26 years old and in that year, he published the following four papers:</p>

<ol><li><p><strong>Photoelectric Effect</strong>: "<em>On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light</em>" <a href="http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905<em>17</em>132-148.pdf" target="<em>blank">\Original</a>\ and <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/?curid=59468" target="</em>blank">\Translated</a>\
This is this week's subject of study. This is the work for which Einstein won the Nobel Prize.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brownian Motion</strong>: <em>"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat.</em>" 
<a href="http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905<em>17</em>549-560.pdf" target="<em>blank">\Original</a>\ and 
<a href="http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/files/eins</em>brownian.pdf" target="_blank">\Translated</a>\
This paper on Brownian motion was the final proof for atoms (revisit week 1) and started the field of physics known as statistical mechanics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Special Relativity</strong>: "<em>On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,</em>" 
<a href="http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Zur<em>Elektrodynamik</em>bewegter<em>K%C3%B6rper" target="</em>blank">\Original</a>\ and
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/" target="_blank">\Translated</a>\
In this paper, Einstein extended the principle of relativity to include electrodynamics and showed that the speed of light was constant in all reference frames.</p></li><li><p><strong>Energy Mass Equivalence</strong>: "<em>Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?</em>" 
<a href="http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905<em>18</em>639-641.pdf" target="<em>blank">\Original</a>\ and
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/E</em>mc2/www/" target="_blank">\Translated</a>\
This was a direct consequence of the previous paper. He showed, among other things, that <lrn-math>\E = mc^2</lrn-math>\.</p></li></ol>

<p>S: Wow, quite a year!</p>

<p>M: Yes, this is unparalleled. There have been many important discoveries in physics, but to have so many, in widely different subjects, in a single year is truly remarkable.</p>

<p>S: What was Einstein's solution to the experiment we just did?</p>

<h2>Light is Quantized</h2>

<p>Einstein's proposition is that light is not really a continuous wave but, instead, arrives in small packets, small bunches - a <strong>"quantum"</strong>. He imagined that each "quantum" of light has an energy given by</p>

<p><lrn-math>\E = hf</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>where f is the frequency and h is a number: Planck's constant. (It was introduced by Max Planck a couple years earlier.) Planck's constant is very important in this course. It is as important as it is small</p>

<p><lrn-math>\h = 6.63\times 10^{-34}\;J\cdot s = 4.14\times 10^{-15} \rm{eV}\cdot s</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>The units are Joules times second or electron volt (1 eV = <lrn-math>\1.602\times10^{-19}</lrn-math>\ J) times second. Einstein then supposed that when light interacts with electrons, it is an all-or-nothing business. The electrons can absorb only 1 quanta of light at a time (not 1.5 not 2). If light is absorbed in quanta, we say that it is <em>quantized</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Just a reminder that eV is just a (very small) unit of energy 1 eV = <lrn-math>\1.602\times 10^{-19}</lrn-math>\ Joules</p></blockquote>

<p>Einstein's equation <lrn-math>\E = hf </lrn-math>\ is super simple and super important. I do expect you to be able to use it, so let's practice.</p>

<p>Let's see how this could work. Imagine that the electrons in a metal like zinc are in a potential well (like a pool) that is 3 eV (3 electron volts) in depth.</p>
