<h2>Einstein&#39;s Explanation. </h2>

<p>In 1905, Einstein had a very productive year.  It is often referred to as the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus<em>Mirabilis</em>papers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Annus Mirabilis&lt;/a&gt;. He was 26 years old and in that year, he published the following four papers:</p>

<ol><li><p><strong>Photoelectric Effect</strong>: &quot;<em>On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light</em>&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905<em>17</em>132-148.pdf&quot; target=&quot;<em>blank&quot;&gt;Original&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikisource.org/?curid=59468&quot; target=&quot;</em>blank&quot;&gt;Translated&lt;/a&gt;
This is this week&#39;s subject of study. This is the work for which Einstein won the Nobel Prize.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brownian Motion</strong>: <em>&quot;On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat.</em>&quot; 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905<em>17</em>549-560.pdf&quot; target=&quot;<em>blank&quot;&gt;Original&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/files/eins</em>brownian.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Translated&lt;/a&gt;
This paper on Brownian motion was the final proof for atoms (revisit week 1) and started the field of physics known as statistical mechanics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Special Relativity</strong>: &quot;<em>On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,</em>&quot; 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Zur<em>Elektrodynamik</em>bewegter<em>K%C3%B6rper&quot; target=&quot;</em>blank&quot;&gt;Original&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Translated&lt;/a&gt;
In this paper, Einstein extended the principle of relativity to include electrodynamics and showed that the speed of light was constant in all reference frames.</p></li><li><p><strong>Energy Mass Equivalence</strong>: &quot;<em>Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?</em>&quot;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/E</em>mc2/www/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Translated&lt;/a&gt;
This was a direct consequence of the previous paper. He showed, among other things, that &lt;lrn-math&gt;E = mc^2&lt;/lrn-math&gt;.</p></li></ol>

<p>S: Wow, quite a year!</p>

<p>M: Yes, this is unparalleled. There have been many important discoveries in physics, but to have so many, in widely different subjects, in a single year is truly remarkable.</p>

<p>S: What was Einstein&#39;s solution to the experiment we just did?</p>

<h2>Light is Quantized</h2>

<p>Einstein&#39;s proposition is that light is not really a continuous wave but, instead, arrives in small packets, small bunches - a <strong>&quot;quantum&quot;</strong>. He imagined that each &quot;quantum&quot; of light has an energy given by</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;E = hf&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>where f is the frequency and h is a number: Planck&#39;s constant. (It was introduced by Max Planck a couple years earlier.) Planck&#39;s constant is very important in this course. It is as important as it is small</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;h = 6.63\times 10^{-34}\;J\cdot s = 4.14\times 10^{-15} \rm{eV}\cdot s&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>The units are Joules times second or electron volt (1 eV = &lt;lrn-math&gt;1.602\times10^{-19}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; J) times second. Einstein then supposed that when light interacts with electrons, it is an all-or-nothing business. The electrons can absorb only 1 quanta of light at a time (not 1.5 not 2). If light is absorbed in quanta, we say that it is <em>quantized</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Just a reminder that eV is just a (very small) unit of energy 1 eV = &lt;lrn-math&gt;1.602\times 10^{-19}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; Joules</p></blockquote>

<p>Einstein&#39;s equation &lt;lrn-math&gt;E = hf &lt;/lrn-math&gt; is super simple and super important. I do expect you to be able to use it, so let&#39;s practice.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see how this could work. Imagine that the electrons in a metal like zinc are in a potential well (like a pool) that is 3 eV (3 electron volts) in depth.</p>
