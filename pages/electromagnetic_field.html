<p>An electron creates an electric field around it. How can we get a magnetic field? The answer turns out to be: move the electron.</p>

<p>A current (moving electrons) going thru a wire creates a magnetic field (B) around it. The first observation of this phenomenon was done by Oersted in 1820. He observed that the needle of a compass laying on top of a wire moved slightly when a current was passing through. There seems to be a magnetic field (denoted B) around the wire but only when the current was on. With no current, there was no magnetic field.</p>

<p>An interesting configuration to set-up is to create a loop of wire in which the electrons are traveling in <em>a circle</em>. The loop of wire then behaves just like a small bar magnet with a North and South pole. In some sense the electrons are spinning around and the movement creates a magnetic field.</p>

<p>Compare the magnetic field created by a loop of current (a circular wire) (as shown in figure &quot;loop&quot;) to the one of a bar magnet (shown in figure &quot;bar magnet&quot;) - they look the same!</p>

<h2>Electromagnet</h2>

<p>A small loop of current is not much of a magnet but if you have many loops of currents, you can create very powerful magnets. In fact, the most powerful magnets in the world are electromagnets. In the &quot;five loops&quot; figure below, you can see the magnetic field lines created by 5 loops of currents. Then below that you can see a &quot;homemade electromagnet&quot;. Just take a wire, loop it many times around a nail, connect the wire to a battery (be careful, it will warm up!) and you will have a magnet- it will pick up paperclips (try it!)!</p>

<h2>Changing E field</h2>

<p>The main message about magnetism that you should remember is that when an electron moves, the electric field E that it creates changes in time and a</p>

<p><strong>changing electric field E creates a magnetic field B.</strong></p>

<p>As it turns out, the reverse is also true. A <strong>changing magnetic field B creates an electric field E.</strong> This is the last key discovery about electricity. It was made by Michael Faraday and it really showed that electricity and magnetism are really linked together into one theory of <em>electromagnetism</em>. Here is a short demo about it</p>
