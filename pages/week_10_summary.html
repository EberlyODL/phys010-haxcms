<ul><li><p>An electromagnetic wave is made of photons. The more intense the light is, the more photons it contains. Each individual photons has an energy given by <lrn-math>\E = h f</lrn-math>\ with <em>h</em> being Planck's constant.</p></li><li><p>The probability of finding a particle at a given point is proportional to the intensity of wave at that point. The more intense the wave, the more probable it is that you will "see" the photon. Use the PHET simulation to go over how probability of photon detection works again.</p></li><li><p>Light interacts with matter on an all-or-nothing basis. We <strong><em>never detect</em></strong> the electromagnetic wave, we only detect photons. But after having received many, many photons, all of which are being detected where the E&amp;M wave would be more intense, it <em>looks like</em> we just have a continuous wave.</p></li></ul>

<p>M: The key phrase that will help you remember is: "<em>Light interacts as a particle, the photon, but it moves like a wave</em>.  </p>

<p>The wave tells the photons where they should go (in a probabilistic manner), but every interaction is with one photon at a time.</p>

<ul><li><p><strong>complementarity</strong>. Review the Complementarity video to go over the big points! Once you know some information about where a photon is (put a hand in the beam) you change the probabilities of where the photons will go, both in a Qbit system and in the more complex double slit experiment.</p></li><li><p>Qbits: Review the video on the Testing Bomb Page. You should be able to explain the Qbit system example in the notes.</p></li></ul>
