<p>To recap. When an electron is bound to a nucleus (which is just a proton for Hydrogen), only a certain set of wavefunction are allowed. This is the so-called orbital model or cloud model of atoms (see Fig. &quot;Cloud Model&quot;).</p>

<p><img src="assets/cloudmodel2.png" width="442" height="177" alt="Cloud model. Proton is centered and electron is represented by a cloud. "></p>

<p>The cloud represents where we are more likely to find the electron.</p>

<ul><li>S: Questions here.</li><li>M: I was wondering whether you were sleeping. . .</li><li>S: Nope, still here. Shouldn&#39;t the proton also be represented by a wavefunction? Why is it a dot in the figure?</li><li>M: Good question! It should be, indeed, but it is much more massive that the electron (about 2000 times) and its wavelength is so much shorter that you can&#39;t see the wave. The more mass you have, the more the standing waves have small wavelengths. The consequence is that the proton is almost always found in the center.</li><li>S: Ok, but technically I am right and you have a wave for both.</li><li>M: Yes.</li></ul>

<p>These waves are quantized. For each wave we can calculate the energy of the electron. Because of the shape of the potential well, the formula for the energy is just</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;E<em>n = -\frac{E</em>1}{n^2}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>As always, the integer n is 1,2,3,. . . If you compare this formula to the electron in a box, you see that it is inverted. This is special to the hydrogen atom. <strong>Note the very important minus sign. For the electron to be bound, the energy must be negative.</strong></p>

<p>The ground state energy &lt;lrn-math&gt;E_1&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is a function of the masses and charges of the proton and electron. We know those, so this number is known as well. It is</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;E_1 = 13.6 \; \rm{eV}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;.</p>

<h2>Spectroscopy</h2>

<p>We now have the energy levels for the hydrogen atom (see Fig. &quot;Energy Levels H&quot;).</p>

<p><img src="assets/energylevelh.png" width="370" height="453" alt="energy levels of Hydrogen goes like 1/n^2"></p>

<p>The figure above is important to understand. The various levels of energy are also called states. If you have a hydrogen atom with the electron in level 2, we say that the atom is in the state n=2. We call that state the first excited state, since it is the first state above the ground state &lt;lrn-math&gt;E_1&lt;/lrn-math&gt;.</p>

<ul><li>M: Hey, Sophie, imagine that you have a box full of hydrogen and that you send a photon with energy of 12 eV. What do you think will happen to it?</li><li>S: I guess the electron could absorb the photon just like in the photoelectric effect.</li><li>M: Correct, lets see if that is possible. Let&#39;s say the electron was in its ground state. What would be the final energy after absorbing the photon?</li><li>S: Hmmm, let&#39;s see. -13.6 + 12 = -1.6 eV. Which I guess is in between level 3 and level 2.</li><li>M: But can the electron be in between two levels?</li><li>S: I guess not.</li><li>M: Indeed, this is very much NOT allowed. It turns out the photon will not be absorbed and it will just pass through.</li><li>S: Ok, makes sense.</li><li>M: But let&#39;s say that the electron was in level 2.</li></ul>
