<p>When electrons interact with the electric force they are often confined to small places. Photons always move but electrons can be stuck within a small area (an atom or a piece of copper wire). </p>

<p>Up to now we have looked at traveling waves, the standard oscillatory wave and the wavepacket.  These are waves representing objects that are moving in a specific direction. Sometimes waves are stuck and don&#39;t move. We call those waves <em>standing waves</em>. A good example is the wave you get on the string of a guitar (Fig. 1).</p>

<p>When you pluck the string on a guitar, it vibrates, but, because the string is attached at both ends, you are restricted in which pattern of vibration you can establish. Places on the string which never move (like the two ends) are called nodes. </p>

<p>In the next figure, you can see the first two harmonics (the first two notes) on a guitar string.</p>

<p>In the demo below, I will produce standing sound waves in a tube. This is analogous to standing waves on a string, except that sound is a wave of pressure and the two ends of the tube are places where the pressure never changes. (These are the nodes.)</p>

<p>** Note: You can tell which harmonic it is by counting the number of antinodes, which are the places where the amplitude is at its maximum.</p>

<p>The upshot and most important thing to remember is that only a specific set of wavelengths are allowed on a string (or in a tube open at both sides). For a string or tube of length L, the possible wavelengths are given by the formula</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>for n = 1, 2, 3, ....</p>

<p>So, for example, the first harmonic, the fundamental, has a wavelength equal to &lt;lrn-math&gt;\lambda_1 = 2L.&lt;/lrn-math&gt; This makes sense since as you can see from Fig. 3, the first harmonic looks like half a wavelength on the whole string.</p>
