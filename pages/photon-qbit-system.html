<p>We can be concrete and look at a very specific example of a Qbit. </p>

<p>Image that we have a beam of photons where we can send one photon at a time on a straight line. This is possible to do using lasers. Let us say that there is an upper path for the photon and a lower path. There are two detectors &lt;lrn-math&gt;D<em>0&lt;/lrn-math&gt; and &lt;lrn-math&gt;D</em>1&lt;/lrn-math&gt; that can tell us whether the photon was in the upper beam or lower beam. If the photon is in the upper beam we will call that &quot;0&quot; and if it is in the lower beam we call it &quot;1&quot;.</p>

<blockquote><p>the messenger will decide where to put the photon, up or down, to transmit the message 0 or 1.  </p></blockquote>

<p>In quantum mechanics, we will be able to do a superposition such that the photon is in a superposition of up and down beams. It is useful to introduce a new notation to distinguish the two states better.. </p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;\lvert 0\rangle&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is a upper beam photon and 
&lt;lrn-math&gt;\lvert 1\rangle&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is a lower beam photon</p>

<blockquote><p>The strange |\&gt; symbol was invented by Paul Dirac and it is called the &quot;ket&quot;. It means &quot;a quantum state&quot; and whatever is inside the |\&gt; is the name of the quantum state. </p></blockquote>

<p>The basic idea for the Qbit is represent in the Fig. &quot;Qbit&quot;. </p>

<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2247|entity<em>type=node|render=display</em>mode|display_mode=image]</p>

<p>Now we can introduce a beam-splitter. In real life those are made with half-silvered mirror. They can be made such that when a photon is hits the beam-splitter, there is a 50% chance that it is reflected and 50% chance that it is transmitted. </p>

<p>If we start with a photon in the lower beam (state &lt;lrn-math&gt;\lvert 1\rangle&lt;/lrn-math&gt;) and send it to a beam splitter, the photon will have 50% chance of being reflected back in the lower beam (back to &lt;lrn-math&gt;\lvert 1\rangle&lt;/lrn-math&gt;) or 50% of passing thru and going to upper beam (&lt;lrn-math&gt;\lvert 0\rangle&lt;/lrn-math&gt;).  </p>

<p>The resulting quantum state after the beam splitter is a superposition of the two states. We can denote this by saying that the state after beam-splitter (let us call it &lt;lrn-math&gt;\psi&lt;/lrn-math&gt;, pronounced &quot;psi&quot;) is </p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;\lvert \psi \rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\lvert 0\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\lvert 1\rangle&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>The factor of &lt;lrn-math&gt;1/\sqrt{2}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; are in fact just &lt;lrn-math&gt;\phi&lt;/lrn-math&gt; (pronounced &quot;phi&quot;), the<em>probability amplitude</em> associated with the photon wave. If you square the &lt;lrn-math&gt;1/\sqrt{2}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;, we get the probabilities. </p>

<p>Make sure you understand the notation, I know this is new and strange but the idea under the notation is simplest. A photon in the quantum state &lt;lrn-math&gt;\psi&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is a photon whose probability is given by the superposition of two waves.  The photon has probability of 1/2 (50%) of being in either state 0 or state 1. </p>

<p>See fig. &quot;superposition&quot;</p>

<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2249|entity<em>type=node|render=display</em>mode|display_mode=image]</p>

<p>Note that when the photon is in a superposition, it is neither in the lower or upper beam. But we if detect it, it will be in one or the other (with equal probability in this example). </p>

<p>A beamsplitter can also reverse the sign of the coefficient depending on the direction you come from. This is because a wave often get its amplitude reversed upon reflection so the state: </p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;\lvert \psi \rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\lvert 0\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\lvert 1\rangle&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>with a minus sign in the lower beam can also be created. In fact, by using two different beam splitters (the one that gives a minus sign is labeled &quot;-&quot; in figure) we will get destructive interference in the lower beam such that the detected photons will always be in the upper beam. </p>
