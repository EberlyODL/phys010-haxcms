<p>Summary:
- The de Broglie relationship tells us that particles behave like waves too. 
-An electron has a wavefunction &lt;lrn-math&gt;\psi&lt;/lrn-math&gt; associated with it. The intensity of the wavefunction tells us where we have more chances of finding the electron.
- When the electron is confined, its wavefunction shows standing wave patterns and the wavelength of the electron wavefunction is quantized. The rules for a particle in a box are the same as a standing wave.
- This leads (via de Broglie&#39;s relationship) to a quantization of the momentum and the energy.
- For an electron in a box, the energy levels go like the harmonic number squared.
- You should be able to describe uncertainty and know what antimatter is.</p>
