<h2>Explaining the Photoelectric Effect</h2>

<p>Let's say that, for a given metal, it costs <lrn-math>\E<em>0</lrn-math>\ of energy to escape the metal (to get out of the swimming pool). This minimum escape energy is often called the <strong>work function</strong>. This number is specific to each metal. When an electron absorbs a photon, it gets <lrn-math>\E=hf</lrn-math>\ of energy. To get out of the metal, this absorbed energy must be greater than <lrn-math>\E</em>0</lrn-math>\; this translates to needing a threshold frequency  of light <lrn-math>\f_0</lrn-math>\</p>

<p><lrn-math>\E<em>{absorbed} = h f >\ E</em>0</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>Threshold frequency is therefore <lrn-math>\f<em>0= E</em>0/h</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>The photon theory of Einstein explains the threshold of frequency we observed in the photoelectric effect easily. The fact that the intensity is proportional to current also makes sense. The more intense the light, the more photons we have, the more electrons will be ejected, and the bigger the current.</p>

<p>The fact that the stopping potential is independent of intensity can also be explained. The stopping potential is equal to the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. The kinetic energy of the electron after they get out of the metal is whatever extra energy they had above <lrn-math>\E_0</lrn-math>\.</p>

<p><lrn-math>\K = hf - E<em>0 = e V</em>{stop}</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>As you can see from this simple formula, the stopping potential only depends on <lrn-math>\E_0</lrn-math>\ which is different for each metal and depends on what the frequency of the shining light f is. It <strong>does not</strong> depend on the intensity.</p>

<p>With this simple hypothesis for light as a photon, Einstein was able to explain all the strange features of the photoelectric effect. Einstein also predicted something new that had not been measured yet. He predicted that the stopping potential should increase linearly with f. This was subsequently verified as you can see in the Figure "Stopping Potential as a function of Frequency" which shows kinetic energy (written as <lrn-math>\e V_{stop}</lrn-math>\) as a function of frequency.</p>
