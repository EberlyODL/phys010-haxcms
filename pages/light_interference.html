<p>In lab #1, you showed that the interference pattern from the double slit experiment is evidence of the notion that light must be a wave. The pattern of dark and bright spots that one gets after a light wave goes through a slit or two slits is impossible to explain if light is just made of particles.</p>

<p>Lets take a second look at interference and learn some more terms.</p>

<h2>Interference take 2</h2>

<p>If you have multiple waves moving in the same direction in the same medium, recall that you can just superimpose them to get the resulting wave. Try this:</p>

<p>Superposition and interference are really synonyms for us (superposition is more general).</p>

<p>Constructive interference occurs when the two waves are exactly in phase (left in figure &quot;constructive and destructive interference&quot;) while destructive interference occurs when they are exactly out of phase (right on the same figure).</p>

<p>The destructive interference happens when one wave is shifted compared to other by an amount that is half a wavelength.</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;\rm{shift} = \frac{\lambda}{2}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; leads to destructive interference.</p>

<p>Constructive interference is easier to explain, the two waves are exactly in phase and it looks like there is no shift between the two. </p>

<p>We go over this again now, because light and interference will come back again as we travel through the quantum world in the next weeks.</p>
