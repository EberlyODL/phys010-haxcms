<p>This week we continued exploring conservation, this time using momentum</p>

<ul><li><p>Conservation of Momentum: The total momentum in a closed system doesnâ€™t change, but the momentum can move among the various parts of the system.</p></li><li><p>Oscillations are defined by two main quantities: the amplitude and the frequency. The amplitude is the measure of how large the displacement (of any kind) is from equilibrium while the frequency is the number of cycles per second. The unit of frequency is 1/s or Hz. We often also use the period <lrn-math>\T = 1/f</lrn-math>\.</p></li><li>A wave is an oscillation that also travels in space. It has all the property of an oscillation but it also has a wavelength <lrn-math>\\lambda</lrn-math>\.</li><li>You should be able to read from x (or y) versus t graph and y versus x graph all the data about a wave.</li><li><lrn-math>\v=\lambda f</lrn-math>\ is an important equation and v does not change <lrn-math>\\lambda</lrn-math>\ and f adjust themselves.</li><li>waves bend on the slow side</li><li>a minimum in speed leads to a channel where waves can be trapped.</li><li>This trapping of waves lead to sound channels and the flying saucer in Roswell was probably a secret flying microphone disk.</li></ul>
