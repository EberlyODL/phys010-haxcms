<h2>Particles have wavelengths too</h2>

<p>What is so special about light? How is it that light is not really a particle, not really a wave, but is, instead, some kind of dual quantity? Some strange &quot;particle-wave.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, nothing is special about light. Every particle in the world is a &quot;particle-wave.&quot;</p>

<ul><li>S: Really, wouldn&#39;t that be very noticeable?</li><li>M: Well, first, we are talking about very small individual particles like electrons or protons. In large groups, the wave nature gets &quot;washed out,&quot; and the reason for that is simple: there is always something continuously interacting within or with a very large object (like a bus). And whenever any object interacts it does so as a particle.</li><li>S:. You mean that all the air molecules that are bouncin against me ensure that I behave like a particle?</li><li>M: This is part of the reason. There is also the fact that the wave for massive objects has a very, very small wavelength. Lets talk about this in detail:</li></ul>

<p>For light the relationship between a particle and the wave is explained by fact that the energy of the light-particle is directly related to the frequency of the light-wave. </p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;E = hf&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>For particles with a mass, you need a more general relationship. To relate energy and wave. This equation shows the wavelength of a particle, was proposed by Louis de Broglie:</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>This means that the wavelength is inversely related to its momentum. We call this the <em>de Broglie wavelength</em>.</p>

<p>For a massless particle like the photon we have that &lt;lrn-math&gt;E=pc&lt;/lrn-math&gt; and you can check (using that &lt;lrn-math&gt;c = \lambda f&lt;/lrn-math&gt;) that the de Broglie relationship ends up being &lt;lrn-math&gt;E=hf&lt;/lrn-math&gt;. But for massive particles the momentum is &lt;lrn-math&gt; p= mv&lt;/lrn-math&gt; (at &quot;low&quot; speed with respect to <em>c</em>). The de Broglie wavelength is then</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{mv}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>The important thing to understand here is that the more massive the object, the smaller the wavelength.</p>

<h2>Showing that the Electron is a &quot;Particle Wave&quot;</h2>

<p>If you send a beam of electron through a small single slit, you will get a diffraction pattern that closely resembles what you get when you shine a laser through a small hole.</p>

<p>These dark and bright fringes are the same kind of interference that we use to prove that light was a wave!</p>

<h2>Contrast between an electron and the photon.</h2>

<p><strong>1. Electrons</strong></p>

<p>The electron is a particle with mass, energy and momentum. There is a wave associated with the electron. We have no name for it, so we call it the &quot;wavefunction of the electrons&quot;. The amplitude squared of that wave tells us the probability of finding the electrons in a region of space.</p>

<p>The relation between the wave and the particle is the de Broglie relation which tell us that the wavelength of the wave &lt;lrn-math&gt;\lambda&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is inversely proportional to the momentum of the particle.</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;\lambda = h/p&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>with <em>h</em> being Planck&#39;s constant. </p>

<p><strong>2. Photons</strong></p>

<p>The photon is a particle with no mass but it still has energy and momentum related by &lt;lrn-math&gt;E=pc&lt;/lrn-math&gt;. There is a wave associated with the photon. We know what that wave is. It is the electromagnetic wave. The amplitude squared of the E&amp;M wave tells us the probability of finding the photons in a region of space.</p>

<p>The relation between the wave and the particle is either de Broglie relation which tell us that the wavelength of the wave &lt;lrn-math&gt;\lambda&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is inversely proportional to the momentum of the particle. </p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;\lambda = h/p&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>with <em>h</em> being Planck&#39;s constant. Or we can also use Einstein&#39;s relation</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;E= hf&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>These two are equivalent because we know that the E&amp;M wave travels at the speed of light so we know that &lt;lrn-math&gt;c=\lambda f&lt;/lrn-math&gt; while we also know from special relativity that the energy of the photon is &lt;lrn-math&gt;E=pc&lt;/lrn-math&gt;.</p>

<p>M: So, back to the wavelength of you. If you weigh 60 kg and are moving at 1 m/s, your wavelength  &lt;lrn-math&gt;\lambda = h/mv&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is &lt;lrn-math&gt;6.62x10^{ -34}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;/(60 kg *1 m/s) = &lt;lrn-math&gt;1.1x10^{-35}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; meters! which means the size of your wavelength is billions of times smaller than an atom. And that, is another reason why you are not all blurry like a wave.</p>
