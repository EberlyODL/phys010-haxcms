<p>The news article for this week is about the 2010 nuclear meltdown in Japan.

<p>While I chose an article related to a nuclear meltdown, I want to remind you that nuclear reactors are still to this day one of the safest forms of power plants. Coal plants cause cancer, too, while Hydroelectric dams do a lot of damage to the environment! Each source of energy has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
