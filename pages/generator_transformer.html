<p>Again let us repeat the main message about magnetism that you should remember.</p>

<p><strong>A changing electric field E creates a magnetic field B</strong></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>A changing magnetic field B creates an electric field E</strong></p>

<p>The first is how a current of electrons can create an electromagnet. The latter is the key to understand the electric generator and the transformer as we will see now. </p>

<p>Download the following simulation directly from the <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/faraday" target="_blank">\Phet website</a>\</p>

<ol><li>First, look at the bar magnet and move it around. You can see how the magnetic field (represented by small compasses at each point in space) changes. <em>At each point in space the magnetic field has some value and some direction.</em></li><li>Second, look at the pickup coil tab, try to move the bar magnet. As you move the bar magnet around, the magnetic field in the wire of the coil changes. As the magnetic field changes, it creates an electric field that then imparts a force on the electron and makes it move. We get a current, the light bulb lights up!</li></ol>

<p>Now look at the electromagnet tab. There you will find a battery that generates a current through many coils of wire. This electromagnet behaves in exactly the same way as the bar magnet in the first tab! If you change the polarity of the current by changing the sign of the voltage on the battery you can reverse the north and south pole of the magnet (look at the red and white parts of the compass). If you stop the current by reducing the battery voltage to 0 V, the magnetic field will disappear everywhere.</p>

<h2>Generator</h2>

<ul><li>M: The last two tabs are what make our electric grid possible. First, let's look a the generator. Go to the last tab and turn the faucet.</li><li>S: Okay. I guess the water turns the bar magnet continuously, which then creates a current.</li><li>M: Yes. The faster the magnet turns, the more current. </li></ul>

<ul><li>S: So, that's why we use AC (alternating current).</li><li>M: Well, actually, there is a more important reason why, but that is indeed how it works....</li></ul>

<h2>Transformer</h2>

<p>Finally, look at the transformer tab of the simulation. At first nothing should be going on but if you go to the right and change the source from DC to AC, you should now see the light bulb light up, but only weakly.</p>

<p>The reason the light bulb lights up is because the AC current constantly changes the B field which then creates a current in the other loop. But, the number of coils in each loop is different and thus the current and voltage are also different (see fig "the basic structure of the transformer").</p>

<p><img src="assets/transformer_0.png" width="495" height="358" alt="Square metal with loops on one side and loops of current on the other side acts as a transformer. "></p>

<p>This is a great tool as it allows us to change the voltage very efficiently.</p>

<ul><li>S: This is pretty cool! So, in the figure, the current goes in on the left (the red) and it goes on the blue, but the wires don't even touch!</li><li>M: Yes, but there is a magnetic field in between.</li><li>S: Is there some kind of flow of energy in there?</li><li>M: Yes! The electrons coming in have kinetic energy, which they lose in creating the B field (the kinetic energy of the electron goes into the B field). The changing B field then moves the electrons in the blue loop.</li><li>M: So, we have kinetic energy in red loop ->\ energy of magnetic field ->\ kinetic energy of electron in blue loop.</li><li>S: Hmmm. I guess that magnetic field is a real thing then! </li></ul>

<p>In the following demo, I demonstrate a transformer in action!</p>

<h2>The reason the electric grid uses AC current:</h2>

<p>... is the transformer (See fig "pole transformer)! To minimize loss in power when we transport electricity over large distances it is better to use high voltage (i.e., low current).</p>

<p>But in your house, high voltage would be dangerous and unusable. Fortunately, it is easy to change the voltage from high to low (or the reverse) using a transformer. And actually, the ratio of high to low voltage is exactly the same as the ratio of the number of wraps of wire around the transformer (just like the strength of an electromagnet depends on the number of wire wraps).</p>

<p><img src="assets/polemount-singlephase-closeup_0.jpg" width="795" height="1200" alt=""></p>

<p>The transformer only works with AC current and this is ultimately why that's the current we get in our house!</p>

<ul><li>S: Wait, I though current was dangerous, not voltage. Why do we have to worry about those "Danger High Voltage" signs?</li><li>M: Well, this goes back to resistance and Ohm's Law <lrn-math>\(I=V/R)</lrn-math>\. High voltage will create a big current, even if your resistance is also large. So, its dangerous all the time, wet hands or dry hands. </li><li>S: I'll be sure to stay away!</li></ul>
