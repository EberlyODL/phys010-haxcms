<h2>Gravity</h2>

<p>Was the first fundamental force to be understood.<br/>(Understanding gravity was a critical step in the scientific revolution &amp; changing our view of the Universe.)  </p>

<p>&amp;  </p>

<p>The fundamental force we still understand the least!<br/>(Understanding gravity is one of the great challenges of modern physics! Particularly unifying gravity with quantum mechanics.)</p>

<h2>Galileo&#39;s experiment</h2>

<p>One of the first big insights about gravity came from Galileo. In the famous &quot;tower of Pisa experiment&quot; (which many historians now believe did not actually happen), Galileo dropped two balls with different masses to show that they land at exactly the same time.</p>

<p>This is counterintuitive, the more massive an object is, the stronger you would expect the force of gravity to be (and indeed that is correct!) Right? </p>

<p>Well, Galileo&#39;s observation is correct: objects with different mass or shape do take the same time to reach the ground irrespective of their mass! If we were able to get rid of air drag on our planet, you would see that in the race between free fall of a hammer and a feather, both reach the ground simultaneously. Below, the astronauts of Apollo 15 tried it on the moon!</p>

<p>A more dramatic version of this was done at a NASA center in Cleveland. </p>

<p>So why is it that the time to fall is the same?</p>
