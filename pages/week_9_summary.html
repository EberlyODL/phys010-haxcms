<ul><li>The Crookes tube is a vacuum tube with an anode and a cathode. The green beam was later identified to be electrons by Thomson.</li><li>Experiment with Crookes tube led to the discovery of X-rays.</li><li>The total energy of an electron is its kinetic energy K plus its potential energy U.</li><li>On a potential energy graph, the turning points are where the energy is all potential with no kinetic (speed=0).</li><li>Solar cell technology is based on the photovoltaic (or photoelectric, essentially the same thing) effect in which light is absorbed by electrons which then create a current.</li><li>The photoelectric effect is a famous experiment that first proved that light was a particle.</li><li><p>The setup of that experiment is the following:</p><ul><li>You shine light on a target on a cathode. Electrons are ejected and move toward an anode. (the whole thing is inside of a vacuum tube). This create a current. We can stop the current by applying a voltage in the opposite direction. We can also change the frequency of the incident light and the intensity to see what happens.</li></ul></li></ul>
