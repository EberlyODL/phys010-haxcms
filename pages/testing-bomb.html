<p>Recap: We have a setup where the photon starts in lower beam. A beam-splitter creates a state where the photon could be either up or down and a second beam-splitter repeats the splitting with a minus sign difference for the wave on the lower beam. The minus sign leads to destructive interference in lower beam so the final state is 100% certain to be in the upper beam. The setup is shown in Fig &quot;Two beam-splitters...). Here is a table of outcome  probabilities</p>

<h3>Outcome for two beamsplitters</h3>

<p>|outcome|Probability (P)
|-------
|photon reaches detector &quot;D0&quot;|1
|photon reaches detector &quot;D1&quot;|0</p>

<p>Imagine we change the setting slightly by putting our hand in the lower beam between the two beamsplitters. Our hand will absorb the photon and let us say that we can feel when a photon hits you. When a photon arrives, you scream &quot;Ow!&quot; </p>

<p>Just like before, having an observer will destroy the interference effect (the hand, not the screaming).  When we send the photon into the apparatus it has 50% chance of striking the hand. If it does, its done, the photon was absorbed by the hand. If it does not  hit the hand than we know the photon has to be in the upper beam before it gets to the final beam-splitter. The second beam-splitter will split halfway between up and down. So the end result is</p>

<h3>Outcome for two beamsplitters and hand in lower beam</h3>

<p>|outcome|Probability (P)
|-------
|photon reaches detector D0|1/4
|photon reaches detector D1|1/4
|photon hits hand|1/2</p>

<blockquote><p>Note that the chance of detecting a photon in detector D1 has increased by putting a hand in the way and blocking part of the beam!!</p></blockquote>

<p>This is another example of complementarity. If we determine in which path the photon was going in the middle of the story, we destroy the interference pattern! The act of measuring changes the state. If the photon does not hit my hand, I will know that it is in the upper beam. I have acquired information which then affect further measurements. </p>

<h2>Testing bombs.</h2>

<p>We can push this to the extreme. Imagine a factory that produces bombs that can be triggered by a single photon. This is probably hard to do so once in a while the factory would produce bombs that are a dud (not working). We would like to be able to know whether a bomb works or not without an explosion. We could just send a photon towards it but then if the bomb works it will explode. We would know that it works, but we would have lost the bomb!</p>

<p>As a quantum physicist, you have an idea. We will put the bomb in the middle lower beam of the setup above (between the beam splitter). If the bomb is a dud, it should do nothing, ever, and we would detect the photon always in detector D0. If the bomb works, it will act as a &quot;hand detector&quot; and it will change the probabilities! </p>

<p>|Bomb is a dud||Bomb is working| |
|-------
|outcome|P|outcome|P
|photon reaches D0|1|photon reaches D0|1/4
|photon reaches D1|0|photon reaches D1|1/4
|bomb explodes|0|bomb explodes|1/2</p>

<p>Ok so we put a bomb to the test, it explodes. You turn to your manager: &quot;Sorry that one was working but it is lost now, I can test another.&quot;</p>

<p>You put another bomb, you detect a photon in D0. You say &quot;Sorry, I cannot tell if its working or not, let us send another photon.&quot;</p>

<p>The next photon arrives in D1. You turn to your manager, this bomb is working!</p>

<h3>This is strange yes.</h3>

<p>Note that the photon never triggered the bomb but the fact that it could have done so was enough to destroy the interference effect and allow the photon to go to D1. The photon was in a superposition of upper and lower beam and this superposed state knew about the bomb even though it never triggered it (it had 50% chance of doing so). </p>

<p><strong>If you are not seriously perplexed by this. Reread this page again.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>If the photon lands in D0 a 100 times, you can tell your manager. There is a very good chance that this bomb is a dud.</p></blockquote>
