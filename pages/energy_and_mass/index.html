<p>In week 2 and 3 we saw that particles that move with speed v have energy and momentum due to their movement. (We are only interested in the energy of movement, the kinetic energy.)</p>

<p>Momentum <lrn-math>\p=mv</lrn-math>\ and kinetic energy <lrn-math>\K= \frac12 mv^2</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>We have also seen that <strong>the momentum and the energy are conserved</strong>.</p>

<h2>Relativistic Energy-Momentum ** do not memorize the equations here. **</h2>

<p>Now that we have learned about the special nature of spacetime, how should we define v in these formulas? Normally the speed is</p>

<p>v = distance over time</p>

<p>but which time should we be using? What's more, with the speed of light being always constant, conservation of momentum and energy does not seem to work anymore.</p>

<p>Einstein was facing these tough questions and he found a solution. He found that there was natural definition for momentum and energy such that they would be conserved like before and such that they work perfectly fine with a speed limit. He proposed that the correct formula for momentum (no need to remember that one) is:</p>

<p><lrn-math>\p = \gamma m v</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>where <lrn-math>\\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}</lrn-math>\ which is a factor always greater than 1. As you get closer and closer to the speed of light the factor <lrn-math>\\gamma</lrn-math>\ grows bigger and so does the momentum!</p>

<p>For the energy, Einstein found the following relation, which should remind you of the Pythagorean theorem:</p>

<p><lrn-math>\E^2 = (pc)^2+(mc^2)^2</lrn-math>\</p>

<p>(this <lrn-math>\p</lrn-math>\ is <lrn-math>\\gamma m v</lrn-math>\ now)
- M: This is the most famous equation in physics.
- S: Hmmm, I thought it was simpler than that.
- M: Let's see. If you want the energy of a particle that is not moving, then <lrn-math>\v=0</lrn-math>\ and <lrn-math>\p=0</lrn-math>\. Then the formula becomes <lrn-math>\E=mc^2</lrn-math>\
- S: Now that's a famous equation!
- M: Indeed. What Einstein found is that even when a particle is not moving it has energy proportional to its mass. This means that mass is just a certain form of energy and one can convert between mass and energy!
- M: But it is really just a special case, the general equation is the one above.</p>
