<ul><li>M: Semiconductors are the raw materials for electronics. The actual machine is the transistor.</li><li>S: I have heard the name before. What does it do?</li><li>M: It is a valve.</li><li>S: That&#39;s it?</li><li>M: No, it can do more than that, and there are many versions of it, but the main usefulness of a transistor is that it is a tiny valve with no moving parts that can be made very, very tiny.</li><li>S: Why do electronics need a valve?</li><li>M: When you turn the super tiny transistor on, current goes through, while when you turn it off, it stops. We denote these two states by a 0 or a 1.</li><li>S: Oh, I see, the transistor is where the 010010 bytes of computer come from!</li><li>M: Exactly!</li></ul>

<p>Here is a very well made video by Veritasium (who has many good videos on Youtube) about the transistor. There is not much to add to the video except to say don&#39;t worry about the last part about tunneling (we will not cover tunneling but there is a brief section in your book if you are interested).</p>

<p>The transistor is so important to everyday life that its electronic symbol can be found on the pavement in a Portuguese University.</p>

<p>The electronic symbol for the transistor shows the three basic components: the <strong>source</strong>, the <strong>drain</strong> and the <strong>base</strong>. Again, the basic functioning is that by turning a voltage on the base, we turn the switch on and we let electrons go from the source to the drain.</p>
