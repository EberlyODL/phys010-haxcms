<h2>The Electric Grid.</h2>

<p>Our life is increasingly dependent on electricity. A modern car contains about 40 different electric motors (to lower the window, operate the car seat, ....)</p>

<p>We are constantly connected to the electric grid and it is a technological feat that is not often appreciated. It is a powerful system that allows you at any time of the day to connect to the wall and get a 120 Volt source of electricity. It is always there, always accessible.</p>

<p>Almost, sometimes it fails, like in 2003. We are not very good at storing electricity and we use it as soon as it is produced. A series of human and technological mistakes in 2003 led to a cascade of overloads that shut down a good part of the North-East electric grid.</p>

<h3>The American Electric Grid Primer</h3>

<ul><li>Have to exactly match load (demand) and supply: can’t have too much electricity generated or too little.</li><li>Load constantly varies with time (as devices are turned on and off), so grid operators constantly monitor grid to adjust supply (add or remove generators from the grid), reroute power through system to where it’s needed.</li><li>The electric grid use alternating current AC (we will learn more about this next). This type of current oscillates back and forth and the whole grid <em>must oscillate in sync and with the same frequency</em>! If a component becomes out of sync with rest of grid, it is shut down.</li><li>Large regions of the grid work together in phase. Separate regions that are not in phase (or at different frequencies) can be connected by high voltage direct current (DC) lines (HVDC) lines.</li></ul>
