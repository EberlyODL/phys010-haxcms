<p>We have seen that electrons (and other matter particles) are described by a wave. We call this wave the wavefunction and we use the symbol</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>to describe it. If matter particles are described by a wave, what does this wave look like?</p>

<p>Well, first of all, it is usually constrained to a small location. When we talked about waves earlier, we used to talk about wave of fixed wavelength and frequency, like in Fig. &quot;Typical Sine Wave&quot; below.</p>

<p>The real wave associated with an electron looks more like the Fig. &quot;Wavepacket&quot;: this is called a wavepacket. If you squared the amplitude of the wavepacket at a given in point in space you will get the probability of finding the particle at that point. For a sine wave, that is going on forever you could find the particle anywhere really but for a wavepacket, chances are that you will find the particle in a small region &lt;lrn-math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/lrn-math&gt; where the wavepacket is not zero (see Fig. &quot;Small Range&quot;)</p>

<p>You can think of a wavepacket has being the sum of a bunch of waves with different wavelength &lt;lrn-math&gt;\Delta \lambda&lt;/lrn-math&gt; as you can see in the animation &quot;Making a wavepacket&quot; below.</p>

<p><img src="assets/sequential_superposition_of_plane_waves_0.gif" width="360" height="223" alt=""></p>

<p>The more waves we use to construct the wavepacket, the more localized in space we can make it.</p>

<p>But we know from the de Broglie relationship that each standard oscillatory wave with a fixed wavelength (Fig. &quot;Typical wave&quot;) corresponds to a fixed momentum &lt;lrn-math&gt;\lambda = h/p&lt;/lrn-math&gt;.</p>

<p>Since a wavepacket is made by combining multiple waves with a range of wavelength. This means that a particle that is described by a wavepacket really has a <strong>range</strong> of possible momentum &lt;lrn-math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/lrn-math&gt; just like it has range of position &lt;lrn-math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/lrn-math&gt;.</p>

<p>One can show mathematically, that in order to localize a wave in space (a wavepacket in a small range &lt;lrn-math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/lrn-math&gt; ), you need to sum a bigger range of momentum. This is known as the uncertainty principle. In equation (with numbers included) this says,</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{2}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>The more precisely we know the position, the more uncertain we are about the momentum.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>This is not magic, it is just a property of waves. To create a localized wavepacket with small uncertainty in position we need to sum multiple oscillatory waves of different wavelength, making the range of momentum uncertain. </p>

<h2>Complementary</h2>

<p>This is also another example of complementary in quantum mechanics. You should remember that when we discussed photons, it was impossible to measure which slits they went through at the same time as measuring the interference pattern. You either measured one or the other. </p>

<p>We have a similar situation here, we cannot measure position and momentum at the same time. If we know the position, the uncertainty &lt;lrn-math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/lrn-math&gt; will be very small, the wavepacket will be very localized but then the uncertainty on momentum will be very large and the speed will be unknown. </p>

<blockquote><p>This is really more applicable to small numbers of particles. With ensembles of particles (like a car), the quantum behavior is erased because of all the interactions. In reality, we can determine the position of a car and its momentum with pretty good accuracy compared to its size. Note also that the product of the uncertainty has to be bigger than the Planck constant which is a very small number. So an uncertainty in the position of the car by 1 cm and of its momentum by 0.1 kg m/s would satisfy the uncertainty principle, and those are pretty big on the scale of an atom!</p></blockquote>
