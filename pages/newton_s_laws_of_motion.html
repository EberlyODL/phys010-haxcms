<p>The basic laws of motion were discovered/synthesized by Isaac Newton in the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. We now know that these laws are not quite right; they are corrected by both relativity and quantum mechanics (as we will see later). For most motion of large objects at normal speed, the corrections are very small and Newton&#39;s laws work beautifully well. </p>

<p>Since this is a class on modern physics, we will not spend much time on Newton&#39;s laws. However, we still need to discuss them to build a foundation for what is to come. </p>

<h3>What is a force</h3>

<p>This is very important. A force is an interaction between 2 objects. There are always at least 2 objects interacting - your job in physics is generally to figure out what the 2+ interacting objects are. Second thing: a force manifests itself as a <em>push</em> or <em>pull</em>. That is how we get to First Law below:</p>

<h3>The First law.</h3>

<blockquote><p><em>Every object in a state of uniform motion will remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This is the most misunderstood of the three laws. It says that if there is no force acting on a object, the object will remain in motion at constant velocity and travel in a straight line.</p>

<p>This law essentially defined the notion of an inertial reference frame as we discussed in the week about space-time. At observer moving at constant velocity is an observer for which the laws of Nature look the same as if the velocity was zero (observer at rest). </p>

<h3>The Second Law.</h3>

<blockquote><p><em>An unbalanced force causes an object to accelerate. This is often mathematically expressed by</em></p><p><em>&lt;lrn-math&gt;F= ma&lt;/lrn-math&gt;. The force which is moving an object equals the mass of the object times its acceleration.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Acceleration measures the change in velocity per unit of time. Remember: change is written using the &lt;lrn-math&gt;\Delta&lt;/lrn-math&gt; symbol which means the difference between the end and beginning.</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the breakdown of that equation:</p>

<p>The time interval between some initial time &lt;lrn-math&gt;t<em>i&lt;/lrn-math&gt; and some final time &lt;lrn-math&gt;t</em>f&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is expressed as &lt;lrn-math&gt;\Delta t = t<em>f -t</em>i&lt;/lrn-math&gt;.</p>

<p>During this time interval, the speed of the object may change from initial value &lt;lrn-math&gt;v<em>i&lt;/lrn-math&gt; to some final value &lt;lrn-math&gt;v</em>f&lt;/lrn-math&gt;. Again the change in velocity is &lt;lrn-math&gt;\Delta v = v<em>f-v</em>i&lt;/lrn-math&gt;. <strong>Remember that velocity has a sign, negative if you move left or positive if you move right.</strong></p>

<p>So acceleration can also be positive or negative, because velocity has a direction. For example, when you go east at 20 m/s and change to go west at 20 m/s in a span of 4 seconds, the acceleration would be</p>

<p>&lt;lrn-math&gt;a = \frac{20 - (-20)}{4} = 10\; m/s^2&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</p>

<p>We will not use acceleration very much in this class. Instead we will use change in momentum which is really the same thing!</p>
