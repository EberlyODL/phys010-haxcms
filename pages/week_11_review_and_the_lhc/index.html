<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to:</p>

<ul><li>LOQua05: apply quantum ideas to electrons with the de Broglie relationship. </li><li>LOQua06: summarize the uncertainty principleÂ </li><li>LOQua07: explain how energy quantization for confined electrons arises</li><li>LOQua11: describe what antimatter is</li><li>
LOQua12: explain what a particle collider is and what it can do.</li></ul>

<h2>News Article</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/physicists-excited-by-latest-lhc-anomaly-1.21865" target="_blank">\Hint of new particles?</a>\</p>

<p>I choose this article because the media often jumps quickly on "hints" of new physics. Way too quickly in my opinion. Almost always, these hints turn out to be nothing. I am betting this particular discrepancy is probably just a fluke and I will wait until more data is collected and analyzed before getting excited. </p>
