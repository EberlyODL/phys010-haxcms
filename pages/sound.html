<ul><li>M: Remember that a wave is just the disturbance that is traveling. The atoms in the medium in which the wave is (the disturbance) do move a bit, but, on average, they donâ€™t go anywhere.</li><li>S: It makes sense. When I go to the beach, I get waves after waves hitting me, but it's really always the same molecules of water each time.</li><li>M: That's right. Another good example is sound.</li></ul>

<h2>Sound</h2>

<p>Sound is a disturbance in the pressure of the air.</p>

<p>When you vibrate a tuning fork or a string, you create regions of <em>compression</em> and of <em>rarefaction</em>. These are the crests and troughs of the wave. Those compressions and rarefactions then travel away from the tuning fork through the air in all directions. If they hit your ear drum... it vibrates, and you hear the sound!</p>

<p>If you vibrate the guitar string twice as slow (reduce the frequency by two) then the distance between the compressed regions will be twice as big (you would double <lrn-math>\\lambda</lrn-math>\).</p>

<p>Just as for any waves, we have:</p>

<p><lrn-math>\ v_{sound} = \lambda f</lrn-math>\</p>

<h2>Speed of Sound</h2>

<p>What is the speed of a sound wave? When you see lightning outside, it often takes a while to hear the thunder. We saw this already in week 1. The speed of sound at normal temperature and pressure is</p>

<p>1 mile per 5 seconds = 1,000 feet per second = 330 meters per second. <br/>This is the same speed as the average speed of molecules in air.</p>

<ul><li>S: I learned last week that if I increase the temperature, I give more kinetic energy to the atoms in the gas. If they have more kinetic energy, then they will move faster... so does that means that sound travels faster on a hot day?</li><li>M: Yes, it does! Pretty cool, isn't it?</li></ul>
