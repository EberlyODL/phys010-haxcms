<p>You have learned a lot of physics in this class but with more knowledge always comes more questions. We will now conclude with two outstanding physics questions. It turns out that 95 % of the Universe is made of dark matter and dark energy and we don&#39;t know what those two &quot;dark&quot; components are! By the end of this class you will have enough knowledge in physics to explain how we don&#39;t know what 95% of the Universe is!</p>

<p>This is a strange point in the history of science. On the one hand, our theories of the Universe have never been so successful. The theory of quantum mechanics (the particle/wave) and of relativity have been verified to hold to unprecedented accuracy. We understand (in varying degrees) all four fundamental forces with electromagnetism being the most understood and the strong nuclear and gravity being the trickier ones.</p>

<p>Physics as a science is rocking and yet when we look at the Cosmos we come back baffled. Most of the energy and matter in the Universe is in the form of dark energy and dark matter. We don&#39;t know what this dark stuff is. We don&#39;t even know if it is just some new type of particle/wave or some completely new building block of Nature.</p>

<p>Of the two, dark matter is the one we are the closest to making some tangible progress in finding out what it is. Dark energy is more mysterious and more thought provoking.</p>

<p>Let us first start with the beginning, before dark matter and dark energy comes a more fundamental and seemingly simple question. Why is the sky dark?(hint: <strong>The reason the sky is dark is not because of dark matter or dark energy!</strong>)</p>

<p>Look at this fun video from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical physics.</p>

<p>If the Universe is infinite with an infinite amount of stars, the sky should always be bright. This is known as Olbers&#39; paradox. We don&#39;t know if the Universe is infinite in size. This is one (of the many) outstanding question we are trying to find out. But as the video showed, we do know that the Universe is evolving and stars have not been there forever. There was a time when there were no stars.</p>

<p>The sky is dark because we can only see the stars for which the light had time to reach us since their formation! (remember, it takes 8 minutes for light from the sun to reach us.. some stars&#39; light has yet to reach earth!)  As we look further in the Universe, we see light that was emitted further in the past. We see stars and galaxies in their younger stages; see Fig. &quot;Looking Back in the Past&quot;. With our best telescope, we can see the very first structure in our Universe!</p>
