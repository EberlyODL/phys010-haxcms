<p>In the first unit we were introduced to the basic building blocks of Nature while in the second unit we saw our first force, electromagnetism, how it connects to light and we studied the particle/wave duality.</p>

<p>The Fig. "Concept Map" shows the basic picture we have been studying. This is not a watered-down version of physics. All of these laws of physics are currently accepted to be true. There are no approximations.</p>

<p>In addition to these basic laws, we have seen that particle/waves interact with each other via fundamental forces. Using these forces, the particles/waves can exchange momentum with one another and affect each other's trajectories.</p>

<p>The four forces of Nature are</p>

<ol><li>Electromagnetism.</li><li>Weak Nuclear force, responsible for the Beta decay. (We did not discuss this force in this class.)</li><li>Strong Nuclear force, which holds the protons and neutrons together. It leads to alpha and gamma radiation, and nuclear fusion/fission.</li><li>Gravity. The subject of this week.</li></ol>
