<p>Before we study waves, we need to start by looking at the basic idea of an <strong>oscillator</strong>. You can get an oscillating behavior (in time) whenever there is a restoring force that wants to continuously bring back the system to equilibrium.</p>

<p>Oscillations are defined by two main quantities: the amplitude and the frequency. The amplitude is a measure of how large the displacement is from equilibrium while the frequency is the number of cycles per second. The unit of frequency is one over second &lt;lrn-math&gt;1/s&lt;/lrn-math&gt; or Hz (Hertz). We often use the period &lt;lrn-math&gt;T=1/f&lt;/lrn-math&gt; which is just the inverse of the frequency. It has units of second(s) and it represents the time for one full oscillation. <strong>Be careful, one full oscillation is one full back and forth.</strong></p>

<p>A mass oscillating (vibrating) on a spring has a regular frequency. The pendulum swinging back and forth in a grandfather clock is also an oscillator with a specific frequency.</p>

<p>The oscillatory behavior of a pendulum or a mass on a spring can be displayed in a graphical manner as shown below.  Note the axis, time is the horizontal axis.</p>

<p>There is a lot of information that you need to be able to pick up from this graph:</p>

<ul><li>Amplitude &lt;lrn-math&gt;x<em>m =\frac12 (x</em>{max} â€“ x_{min})&lt;/lrn-math&gt;</li><li>Period T = time to repeat oscillation (e.g., peak to peak)</li><li>Frequency f = 1/T. This is the number of oscillations per seconds. The units for frequency are Hertz.</li></ul>
