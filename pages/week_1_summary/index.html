<p>The list below  has some facts for a further level of detail. This list is not exhaustive please refer to your textbook and to the webpages before for the detailed information.</p>

<h3>Numbers and Units</h3>

<ul><li>a nanometer is <lrn-math>\10^{-9}</lrn-math>\ m and atoms are about 0.1 nm in size.</li><li>there are <lrn-math>\10^{23}</lrn-math>\ atoms in a mole and this is more than the numbers of stars in our galaxy!</li><li>When you multiply two numbers in exponential notation you add the exponents. <lrn-math>\10^{23} \times 10^{-10}</lrn-math>\ gives <lrn-math>\10^{23-10}= 10^{13}</lrn-math>\.</li><li>We will use SI units of meters, second and kilogram.</li></ul>

<h3>Atomic Theory</h3>

<ul><li>Atoms are small, numerous, ageless and move around constantly.</li><li>Brownian motion refers to the random motion of large particles when atoms constantly hit them.</li></ul>

<h3>Structure of Atoms</h3>

<ul><li>Atoms are made of protons (+ 1 electric charge) and neutrons (0 charge) surrounded by electrons (-1 negative charge).</li><li>Atoms are mostly just made of void or nothing.</li></ul>

<h3>Elements</h3>

<ul><li>Each element in the periodic table has an atomic number, which is the number of protons. Change the number of protons and you change the element.</li></ul>
